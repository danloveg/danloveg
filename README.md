## Hi there 👋

I primarily work with Python but am interested in plenty of other technologies! Things I'm working on:

- Learning Ansible to automate my home server deployment
- Building web applications for archives
- Taking a course in AI and machine learning

Let me know if you need help tracking down tricky bugs 🐛 - that's what I do best!
